Sidhartho is the actual name for SID - the livefeed rover. The roman II is just his version upgraded. SID was initially a 4 wheel drive robot capable of being manually controlled by a infrared remote and later using bluetooth terminals over a laptop. With a Single board computer intregation over a microcontroller he has all the needed hardware power in his version II avatar to stream live video footage just as the moon rover.In very simple words you can leave Sid II at classroom to attend your lectures while you stream the lecture over your laptop or tablet. Amazing isn't it ? He is technically a telepresene robot build using Arduino Uno as microcontroller to drive his dc motor(slave) and Raspberry Pi 2 (master) which computes all the complex algorithms to stream back the video. 
​
But hold on ! SID II is a robot so is he intelligent ? Well yes he is learning to be and needs your help 1 SID II platform has been enabled to hold two cameras - one we have talked already to stream video through a HD webcam and he also has a Raspbeery Pi Camera module intregated which watches out for shapes which he has been taght to identify. Sid II can identify blue shaped balls for other coloured balls and also chases the BLUE ball  if you throw away the ball. His AI is powered by OpenCV2 which is an excellent API and library source for computer vision. You can also train Sid II to count number of objects lying in your room and also teach him to identify you from many faces
